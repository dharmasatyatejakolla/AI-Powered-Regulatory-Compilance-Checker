# Project Title: AI-Powered-Regulatory-Compilance-Checker
### Project Statement: 
This project aims to develop an advanced AI system that automates the review and updating of contracts to ensure compliance with regulatory standards across various jurisdictions, such as GDPR and HIPAA. The solution will leverage LLMs like OpenAI GPT, Meta LLaMA, and LangChain to automatically detect missing clauses, assess risks, and recommend amendments based on the latest regulatory updates, industry standards, and contract-specific parameters. By integrating and scraping data from multiple sources like Google Sheets, public websites, and emails, the system will provide real-time compliance checks and notifications. This will significantly reduce manual efforts in contract management and minimize compliance risks. 

#### Outcomes: 
● Automated compliance checking for contracts across multiple regulatory frameworks. 

● Real-time risk assessment and context-based clause recommendations.

● Continuous monitoring and application of regulatory updates to active contracts. 

● Streamlined contract management process with reduced manual intervention.
